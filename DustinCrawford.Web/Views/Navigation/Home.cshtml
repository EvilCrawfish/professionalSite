                    <p>I am a junior-level software developer currently working as an IT Intern at ZirMed, Inc. and based in Louisville, Kentucky. My goal as a professional is to continuously further my knowledge of the many different software development methodologies, and to then utilize my knowledge of these methodologies along with both domain-driven and test-driven design to effectively and efficiently develop flexible real-world applications.</p>

                    <p>With experience in developing small-scale applications in C# and the .NET framework, I am currently broadening my skillset by assisting in the development of much larger-scale applications at ZirMed. It is my first real endeavor into developing real-world applications.</p>
